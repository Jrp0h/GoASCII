# GoASCII

I've always wanted to create a image to ASCII converter, so here it is. The goal is to create it without external help (except docs). :)
It even animates gifs in the terminal!

# How to use

To load an image just open a terminal in the directory with the main.go file, move the file to this directory and then just run `go run . imageName.extension`
It works with gifs, pngs and jpegs.
